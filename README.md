README: RAG-Based Text-to-SQL System with Modular Query Routing
Overview
This project implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered Text-to-SQL system, which intelligently routes natural language queries to the appropriate SQL execution module based on query complexity.

With the increasing power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding, converting human-like questions into structured SQL queries has become possible. However, SQL queries can vary in complexity. Some are simple (e.g., retrieving customer records), while others require complex joins, aggregations, or schema lookups.

This system ensures efficient and accurate SQL generation by:

Dynamically classifying the query based on its complexity.
Routing it to the correct module for execution.
Retrieving relevant database schema to generate more accurate SQL statements.
What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that enhances LLM-generated responses by incorporating retrieved knowledge from an external source (e.g., a database, document repository, or knowledge base).

Traditional LLMs rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge, which may be outdated or lacking specific details. RAG improves this by dynamically retrieving relevant data before generating responses.

How RAG Enhances Text-to-SQL
Retrieves database schema information before query generation.
Uses historical queries to refine generated SQL statements.
Reduces hallucination (incorrect SQL generation) by grounding responses in actual database structures.
Role of LangChain in the Project
LangChain is a framework designed to integrate LLMs with external data sources to build intelligent applications.

How LangChain is Used Here
SQL Query Generation:

Uses LangChain‚Äôs ChatPromptTemplate to structure query-generation prompts.
Uses LangChain‚Äôs create_sql_query_chain to build a pipeline for processing SQL queries.
Database Interaction:

Uses LangChain‚Äôs SQLDatabase utility to connect to the SQLite database.
Uses LangChain‚Äôs SQLDatabaseToolkit to facilitate SQL query execution.
Query Execution Pipeline:

Uses LangChain‚Äôs RunnablePassthrough to pass SQL queries through a sequence of processing steps.
By combining LangChain with LLMs and RAG, the system ensures more accurate SQL query generation and efficient execution.

Query Routing System
At the core of this system is the Query Router, which classifies and directs SQL queries to the appropriate module for execution.

How Query Routing Works
User inputs a natural language question (e.g., "What is the most sold genre?").
The router classifies the query based on its structure:
Simple queries ‚Üí many_tables.py
Aggregations & GROUP BY ‚Üí HighCardinalityAgent.py
Complex subqueries ‚Üí agent_text_to_sql.py
Schema lookups ‚Üí simple_text_to_sql.py
Routes the query to the correct module, executes it, and returns results.
This prevents simple queries from being over-processed and ensures complex queries receive sufficient execution power.

LLMs in Text-to-SQL Conversion
LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini can generate syntactically correct SQL queries from natural language. However, LLMs have limitations, which is why RAG and query routing are critical.

LLM Contributions in This Project
Classifies query types (simple, aggregate, complex, schema-related).
Generates SQL queries based on database schema information.
Reformats SQL queries for proper syntax.
Provides natural language explanations of query results.
By combining LLMs with LangChain‚Äôs structured retrieval mechanisms, the system ensures that queries are both accurate and optimized.

Understanding Word Embeddings in SQL Query Optimization
To further improve query classification and execution, word embeddings can be used.

Word Embeddings allow the system to understand semantic similarities between words in SQL queries.
Instead of treating queries as plain text, embeddings convert them into numerical representations for pattern recognition.
This improves query classification accuracy, ensuring queries are routed to the correct module.
Example:

"Find total revenue" and "Get sum of sales" may have different wording, but embeddings recognize their similarity.
This enhances SQL query classification and execution efficiency.
Modular Query Execution Agents
The system is designed with four modular Text-to-SQL agents, each specializing in a different type of query.

1Ô∏è‚É£ General SQL Queries: many_tables.py
Handles:

Basic SELECT queries
Single-table lookups
Simple WHERE conditions
üìå Example Query:
‚û°Ô∏è "List all customers who spent more than $500."
‚úÖ Routes to many_tables.py ‚Üí Executes a basic SELECT query.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregation Queries: HighCardinalityAgent.py
Handles:

Queries using COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY
Aggregations over large datasets
üìå Example Query:
‚û°Ô∏è "What is the most sold genre?"
‚úÖ Routes to HighCardinalityAgent.py ‚Üí Executes a GROUP BY query.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced SQL Queries: agent_text_to_sql.py
Handles:

Queries with nested subqueries
Joins across multiple tables
Deep filtering and ranking
üìå Example Query:
‚û°Ô∏è "Who are the top 5 artists with the most album sales?"
‚úÖ Routes to agent_text_to_sql.py ‚Üí Executes a SELECT-FROM-(SELECT) query.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Schema & Metadata Queries: simple_text_to_sql.py
Handles:

Retrieving database schema information
Listing tables, columns, and data types
üìå Example Query:
‚û°Ô∏è "List all tables in the database."
‚úÖ Routes to simple_text_to_sql.py ‚Üí Executes a PRAGMA table_list query.
